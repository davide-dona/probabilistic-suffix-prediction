    Two bounds apply, in two different units: `prefixes_upper_bound` counts prefixes, and
    `generation_rows_upper_bound` counts the rows they expand into, one prefix being
    `num_samples` rows. They are weighed in rows, since rows are what decoder memory is spent on,
    and the smaller of the two is divided back into prefixes.

    Args:
        inference: Provides `generation_rows_upper_bound`, the row budget both passes share.
        num_samples: How many suffixes the pass being sized draws per prefix, which is what one
            prefix costs in rows: `inference.validation_samples` or `inference.evaluation_samples`.
        prefixes_upper_bound: Ceiling on prefixes per call, typically `dataloader.batch_size`.

        batch: A batch from `TraceDataset`, already on the model's device.
        num_samples: How many suffixes to draw per prefix.
        codec: The codec the split was encoded through, read here in the decode
