    collapse - a model answering every prefix with one central suffix scores well on it - so a
    grid holding temperatures below 1.0 would be free to sharpen its way to a deterministic
    decoder, which is the one thing the arm that draws per step exists not to be. Recall charges
    for that directly, precision charges for spraying the tail to buy it back, and `CLAUDE.md`
    already names the pair as what says whether the draws cover what the log continued with.
