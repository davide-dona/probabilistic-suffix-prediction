    The two sets of suffixes are read as stochastic languages, the generated one uniform over the
    draws and the observed one weighted by how often each continuation occurred, and compared by
    the optimal transport cost of turning the first into the second under the normalized
    Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Reported as a similarity so it reads the way every other share
    here does.

    Solved over every continuation the prefix was observed to take. The short prefixes of a large
    log run to a few thousand of them, which the exact solver handles in tens of milliseconds, and
    dropping the light tail is not free: those prefixes are the ones a log revisits most, so an
    approximation there would move the mean of a tenth of the split.

    Both sides are held as distinct sequences carrying the mass of the draws or occurrences they
    stand for, which is the same stochastic language a row per draw would spell out and a smaller
    problem to solve: a run whose draws collapse onto a handful of suffixes gets a matrix that many
    rows tall rather than one row per draw.

    Args:
        suffixes: The distinct generated suffixes, on the index's scale.

    One 1-Wasserstein distance per activity, between the cycle times pooled over every draw and the
    ones pooled over every occurrence of the prefix, averaged with each activity weighed by how
    often the log ran it. Grouping by the activity is what makes each of them a comparison of two
    conditional distributions, so a draw running longer or shorter than an occurrence normalizes
    away rather than leaking into the timing. Read by position instead, one inserted event shifts
    every cycle time after it and the number reports as a timing error what the activities were
    wrong about.

    An activity only one side ran is skipped. Writing an activity the log never took after this
    prefix, or never writing one it did, is a control-flow error, and `emsc`,
    `continuation_precision` and `continuation_recall` are what charge for it; counting it here
    would restate it as a timing error, which is the same mistake reading the cycle times by
    position makes.

    Both sides are small, so this is biased upward the way `length_wasserstein` and
    `remaining_time_wasserstein_days` are. The bias follows the draw count and the prefix's
    occurrence count, both of which every model of a log shares, so it is a number to compare
    models on rather than a distance to quote on its own.
