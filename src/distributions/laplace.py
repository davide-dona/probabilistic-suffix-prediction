class Laplace:
    """A Laplace distribution, `[...]` per field, parameterized by its median and its log-scale.

    What both time heads are written in. The family is chosen for what its mode is: the minimizer
    of `|mean - target|` is the conditional *median*, and the median is what the report's
    `*_ae_*_days` columns score. A squared error would fit the conditional mean instead, over
    durations that are standardized raw minutes with nothing but a 99.9-percentile filter guarding
    their tail, and the tail would set the fit. The same tail is why the family matters now that a
    head is drawn from: an `exp(-|x|)` tail reaches a long wait without the scale being widened
    everywhere to buy it, where a Gaussian pays for that reach with mass below zero, which
    `inference.generate` can only clamp onto a spike at 0 minutes.

    A head that emits its own scale can buy its way out of a hard position by widening, which is
    the price of letting it be drawn from: a model whose draws come from its heads has to say how
    wide they are. A head that is read at its mode instead pins `logscale` to 0, which leaves
    `beta_nll` the plain absolute error and `scale_penalty` exactly 0.0, and leaves `sample`
    nothing to add beyond unit-scale noise no caller asks for.
