    A report holds the mean of every metric at every length and says nothing about how well that
    many prefixes pin it down. That is what the per-prefix scores already hold, and this is where
    they are reduced to it: how far a mean could be off is a property of the scores it was taken

        metrics: Which metrics of `src.evaluation.scores.METRICS` to bound. Named by the caller
            rather than taken to be all of them, a page usually drawing a handful.
        axes: Which length breakdowns to bound them over, the two `read_reports` is keyed by that a
