class Transformer(SuffixModel):
    """An encoder-decoder transformer that predicts a trace's suffix from its prefix, with no
    latent at all: the same backbone as `TransformerCVAE` with the latent path taken out.

    It is the arm the CVAE is read against, so it is the same everywhere the latent does not
    reach: one embedding space, the same encoder over the prefix, the same decoder
    cross-attending over its events, the same time targets scored by the same `time_loss`.
    What differs is where the variability lives, and the heads are the whole of it here: with
    nothing conditioning the decoder, two runs of one prefix could only be the same suffix, so
    every channel it writes is drawn - the activity from its logits, each time from its head's
    Laplace. That is exactly the per-step noise the latent exists to avoid, which is the
    comparison.

    All three heads and not only the activity, because the arm's answer to where the variability
    lives has to hold for everything it emits. A remaining time is read at position 0, before any
    activity has been written, so it has no drawn path to inherit a spread from: without a scale of
    its own it would be one number in every sample of a prefix, which is the arm being unable to
    speak about the quantity rather than a finding about the arm. `Laplace.beta_nll` is what makes
    that affordable, holding the median's gradient at what a plain absolute error would give it so
    the scale cannot be paid for out of the activity head through the trunk they share.

    Flow, with `prefix` and `suffix` both padded to `max_seq_len`:
        prefix                -> prefix events (for the decoder)
        prefix events, suffix -> an activity, the wait until it and a remaining time, at every
                                 suffix position
