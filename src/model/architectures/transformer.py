class Transformer(SuffixModel):
    """An encoder-decoder transformer that predicts a trace's suffix from its prefix, with no
    latent at all: the same backbone as `TransformerCVAE` with the latent path taken out.

    It is the arm the CVAE is read against, so it is the same everywhere the latent does not
    reach: one embedding space, the same encoder over the prefix, the same decoder
    cross-attending over its events, the same point time heads scored by the same `time_mae`.
    What differs is where the variability lives, and the activity head is the whole of it here:
    with nothing conditioning the decoder, two runs of one prefix could only be the same suffix,
    so the activity is sampled from its logits at every step. That is exactly the per-step noise
    the latent exists to avoid, which is the comparison.

    A wait still varies from draw to draw, because it is read off an activity path that was drawn.
    A remaining time does not: it is read at position 0, before any activity has been written, so
    every sample of one prefix opens on the same number. That is what an arm with no latent can
    say about a quantity settled before its first step, and it is a result rather than a gap.

    Flow, with `prefix` and `suffix` both padded to `max_seq_len`:
        prefix                -> prefix events (for the decoder)
        prefix events, suffix -> an activity, the wait until it and a remaining time, at every
                                 suffix position
