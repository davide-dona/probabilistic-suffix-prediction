    Save a checkpoint holding everything a run needs to be rebuilt or picked back up.

    The run's config travels with the weights, so the same model can be rebuilt later without
    being told a single hyperparameter, and the rest of the training state travels with them,
    so `pipelines/train.py -r` can carry on from here rather than from scratch.

    Args:
        model: The model whose weights to save.
        experiment_config: The run's whole `ExperimentConfig`, dumped to plain data, so that
            resuming needs nothing but this file. Its `model` section is written out beside it,
            since that is all `TransformerCVAE.from_checkpoint` reads.
        step: The optimizer step the weights are from. The filename does not say, so the file
            has to.
        selection_score: That step's generation score, the number the best is chosen on.
        run: Which run these weights belong to, so a resumed run keeps writing to the same
            TensorBoard directory and the same files, and so the generations they produce are
            named after the run rather than after the file the weights were read from.
        optimizer_state: The optimizer's `state_dict`.
        early_stopping_state: The `EarlyStopper`'s `state_dict`, which carries the best score
            seen as well as the patience count.
        rng_state: The random streams, as captured by `training/train.py`'s `rng_state`.
        path: Where to write, parent directories included.
    Returns:
        The path written to.
