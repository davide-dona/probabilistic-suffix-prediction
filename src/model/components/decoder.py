    once per pass for what each layer is modulated by; with no latent every layer is handed
    `UNCONDITIONED` instead and the stack is the plain pre-norm decoder underneath.

    Where a model's variability lives decides how its activity head is read, which is what
    `sampling` says. A conditioned decoder declares none and is read greedily, one suffix per z: a
    whole suffix drawn from one latent is a coherent alternative continuation, where a per-step
    draw walks off the process's language while still looking locally plausible. A decoder with no
    latent has nowhere else to put its variability, so it declares a sampler and draws the activity
    from its logits at every step.

    The time heads are point regressors either way, and that is the whole of what they are: a
    single standardized number, scored by the absolute error. A head that emitted a scale of its
    own would be a second difference between the two arms, one the latent does not reach, and it
    would be paid for out of the activity head - a scale is free to shrink, and every step it
    shrinks by multiplies the gradient the shared trunk sees from the times against the one it sees
    from the activities. What a wait could have been is the latent's to carry where there is one.
    Where there is not, a wait still varies from draw to draw, because it is read off an activity
    path that was itself drawn; a remaining time, read at position 0 before any activity is
    written, does not, and that is a result about this arm rather than a gap in it.
