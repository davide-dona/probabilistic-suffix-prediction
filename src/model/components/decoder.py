        in the z each was given.

        Args:
            z: The sampled latent, `[batch_size, latent_dim]`.
            prefix_encoded: The encoded prefix events, `[batch_size, prefix_seq_len, d_model]`.
            prefix_pad_mask: True where a prefix position holds padding.
            max_steps: Hard cap on the suffix length, for generations that never emit EOT.
        Returns:
            The generated suffixes, the length of each, and the remaining time of each.
