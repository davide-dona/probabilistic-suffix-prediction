    Train a model on a dataset, logging to TensorBoard and saving checkpoints.

    Every validation writes a checkpoint to `paths.LAST_CHECKPOINT`, whether or not the step is
    the best one, and a validation that improves on the best writes a second copy to
    `paths.BEST_CHECKPOINT`. Either file can be handed back as `resume`.

    Args:
        model: The model to train, already on `training.device`.
        train_loader: Batches to learn from.
        val_loader: Batches to score teacher-forced, every `training.val_every_n_steps` steps.
        generation_loader: Prefixes to generate suffixes for on the same cadence. A far smaller
            slice than `val_loader`, since a suffix costs one decoder pass per event.
        generation_samples: Suffixes to draw per prefix on that pass, normally
            `inference.validation_samples`, which is smaller than the
            `inference.evaluation_samples` a report is built from: a curve is read for its shape
            over steps rather than against a report's numbers.
        codec: The codec the splits were encoded through, passed on to the
            generation pass so its remaining times are scored in minutes.
        dataset: The log being trained on, naming the validation split's continuation index the
            selection score is read against.
        run: What every file this run writes is named after (see `src/paths.py`). One
            TensorBoard directory is one run, so an identity reused across runs overlays their
            curves instead of listing them side by side; what makes its tag unique is the
            caller's business.
        experiment_config: The whole `ExperimentConfig`, dumped to plain data, written into
            every checkpoint so the run can be rebuilt and carried on from the file alone.
        generator: The generator the training loader shuffles with, whose state is saved and
            restored along with the rest.
        resume: A checkpoint to carry on from, read by `load_checkpoint`, or `None` to start
            from step zero. Its step, weights, optimizer state, early-stopping state and random
            streams are all restored.
        loss_config: The KL annealing schedule.
        optimizer_config: The optimizer hyperparameters.
        training: Step budget, validation cadence, gradient clipping and device.
        early_stopping_config: When to give up.
