    Train a model on a dataset, logging to W&B and saving checkpoints.

    A validation that improves on the best selection score so far overwrites
    `paths.BEST_CHECKPOINT`; no other step is kept. A run that ends, however it ends, is over:
    there is no carrying one on, so nothing here writes the optimizer, early-stopping or random
    state a resume would have read.

    Args:
        model: The model to train, already on `training.device`.
        train_loader: Batches to learn from.
        val_loader: Batches to score teacher-forced, every `training.val_every_n_steps` steps.
        generation_loader: Prefixes to generate suffixes for on the same cadence. A far smaller
            slice than `val_loader`, since a suffix costs one decoder pass per event.
        generation_samples: Suffixes to draw per prefix on that pass, normally
            `inference.validation_samples`, which matches the `inference.evaluation_samples` a
            report is built from: the selection score and the reported one are read at one budget.
        codec: The codec the splits were encoded through, passed on to the
            generation pass so its remaining times are scored in minutes.
        dataset: The log being trained on, naming the validation split's continuation index the
            selection score is read against.
        run: What every file this run writes is named after (see `src/paths.py`), what its W&B
            run is identified by (`src.identity.wandb_id`) and, minus its tag, which group and
            Artifact lineage it belongs to. One W&B run is one identity, so an identity reused
            across runs overlays their curves instead of listing them side by side; what makes
            its tag unique is the caller's business.
        experiment_config: The whole `ExperimentConfig`, dumped to plain data, written into the
            checkpoint so the model can be rebuilt from the file alone.
        optimizer_config: The optimizer hyperparameters, its learning rate's warmup included.
            The warmup is stepped per optimizer step, so it means the same on every dataset.
        training: Step budget, validation cadence, gradient clipping and device.
        early_stopping_config: When to give up.
