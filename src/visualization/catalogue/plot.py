    """One figure of the catalogue, covering every log at once: what its file is called, which
    length breakdowns it is drawn against, and the panels it draws.

    A panel is drawn once per breakdown, so the figure holds one row per pair of the two and one
    column per log. A panel groups one or more metrics onto the same axes: an estimator together
    with the log's own value it is read against, where the process gives one, so the target a line
    is judged by sits on its panel rather than in a panel of its own. Naming both breakdowns puts
    them in one figure rather than in two, which is worth doing where the two readings say
    different things and not otherwise: they are not independent, since every prefix of a case is
    scored and so a long prefix leaves a short suffix.

# Every figure of the catalogue.
# Each one draws a group of panels against one or both length breakdowns (PREFIX and SUFFIX).
# One column per log, one row per panel and breakdown, one line per model within a panel, plus the
# log's own line where a panel names it too.
#
# A quantity a model answers both ways is one figure with a row each rather than two files: the
# point estimate and the sample mean are read against each other, and two figures of one quantity
# carry two legends and two sets of lengths to say it.
#
# Every line drawn here carries the confidence interval `src.uncertainty.intervals` bounds that
# length's mean by, so a panel says not only where each model sits but whether the models are
# really apart there and whether one is really below the log's own line.
