    """One comparison table: what its file is called, which breakdown it summarizes (always the
    overall one, a table comparing runs over their whole split), the sentence its caption has to
    carry, and the columns it holds.

    A table answers one of the questions the paper asks of a model, so the columns are the metrics
    that question is settled on and no others. Rows are a block per log, one per model within it.

    The headers carry no unit. A name and a name plus `[days]` set to different heights in an
    equal-width column, which is what left the header row ragged, so the units are stated once in
    `note` and written into the caption instead of four times over the columns.

# One table per question a mean can answer. Fidelity is one of the two goals stated for the model;
# the two accuracy tables are neither of them, but the comparison against a deterministic
# baseline (`accuracy-point`) and the check against the prefix's own ground truth
# (`accuracy-generative`) on the ground the literature already reads a model on.
#
# Conformance, the other goal, is not tabulated: every model of every log sits within a few points
# of the log's own conformance, where a mean over the whole split says nothing a reader can act on.
# It is drawn by `conformance-by-suffix-length` against that log's own line instead, where the
# lengths and the bands say where a model really parts from the process.
#
# A point estimate beats the mean of ten stochastic draws almost by construction, so the two never
# share a column; where a table holds both, each column says which of them it is.
#
# Every column names a metric with a direction. One without has no best value, so its cell is a
# number a reader cannot rank and the emphasis can never mark; those are the log's own values,
# which `FIGURES` draws as the log's own series, and the diagnostics of a run, which no page draws.
