            caller makes, not one to be inferred from a filename. It carries the config of the
            run that wrote it, so nothing about the model or the dataset is passed alongside it.
        device: Overrides the run's own `training.device`, e.g. to generate on a different
            machine than the one it trained on. `None` keeps it.
        num_samples: How many suffixes to draw per prefix, or `None` for the run's own
            `inference.evaluation_samples`.
        tuning: A tuning report to read the sampler out of, or `None`. Named rather than looked
            up beside the checkpoint: which operating point a set of weights is read at is a
            decision the caller makes, and the report is checked against the checkpoint hash
            before it is used.
        sampling: The sampler to draw with, or `None` for the one the run trained under.
